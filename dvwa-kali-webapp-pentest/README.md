# DVWA Kali Web App Pentest

This repository contains various resources and scripts for the DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) Kali web application penetration testing. 

## Project Overview
This project is aimed at providing a comprehensive guide and resources to set up and perform various penetration tests on DVWA using Kali Linux. 

## To Do
- Add detailed documentation for each script and architecture.

- # DVWA Web Application Pentest Lab (Kali Linux)

## Overview
This repository documents a **legal, self-hosted web application penetration testing lab** performed from **Kali Linux** against **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** running on **Windows 10 + XAMPP**.

The project demonstrates **Linux-first offensive security skills**, including manual exploitation and automated attacks using industry-standard tools.

---

## Lab Architecture
- **Attacker:** Kali Linux (VM)
- **Target:** Windows 10 (VM)
- **Web App:** DVWA (PHP / MySQL)
- **Web Server:** Apache (XAMPP)
- **Target IP:** `10.10.10.10`
- **Port:** `8080`
- **Network:** Isolated internal / lab network

---

## Tools Used
- `nmap` – service discovery & fingerprinting
- `whatweb` – web application fingerprinting
- `curl` – HTTP exploitation, cookie & CSRF handling
- `sqlmap` – automated SQL injection exploitation
- `bash` – automation & workflow scripting

---

## Vulnerabilities Exploited
- SQL Injection (authenticated)
- Command Injection
- Weak security configuration
- Insecure input handling

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Linux CLI–only exploitation (no browser / DevTools)
- Session cookie handling (`PHPSESSID`)
- CSRF token extraction and reuse
- URL encoding pitfalls and mitigation
- SQL injection (manual + automated)
- Professional pentest workflow documentation
